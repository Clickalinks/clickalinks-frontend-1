## Script Version 1: Small Business Owner

**[0:00-0:08] Introduction**
"I run a small shop in Devon. Advertising was always too expensive for my budget."

**[0:08-0:18] Discovery**
"Then I found ClickaLinks. Just £1 per day? I thought it was too good to be true. But it's real."

**[0:18-0:30] Experience**
"Within a week, I saw new customers coming in. The fair rotation means I get seen just as much as bigger brands. No favorites, just results."

**[0:30-0:40] Results**
"Three months in, and it's been the best advertising investment I've made. Affordable, effective, and fair."

**[0:40-0:45] Recommendation**
"If you're a small business owner, try ClickaLinks. Visit clickalinks.com"

## Script Version 2: Online Store Owner

**[0:00-0:10] Problem**
"As an online store, getting visibility without breaking the bank was impossible. Google Ads? Too expensive. Social media? Too time-consuming."

**[0:10-0:22] Solution**
"ClickaLinks solved it. £1 per day gets my deals in front of thousands. The automatic rotation is brilliant - everyone gets fair play."

**[0:22-0:35] Results**
"Traffic increased 40% in the first month. Real customers, real sales. And I'm spending less than I did on one Google Ad."

**[0:35-0:45] Closing**
"ClickaLinks works. Simple as that. Check it out at clickalinks.com"
