- "Why Every Advertiser Gets Equal Visibility"

### Body:

Hi [Name],

One question we get asked a lot: "Will my ad get seen, or will bigger brands dominate?"

**The Answer: Fair Rotation**

At ClickaLinks, we use an automatic shuffle system that rotates all advertisements every 2 hours. This means:

✅ **Equal Opportunities** - No advertiser gets stuck in a corner  
✅ **Fair Distribution** - Everyone gets time in prime spots  
✅ **Automatic** - No manual intervention, completely fair  
✅ **Transparent** - You can see it happening in real-time

**What This Means For You:**
Whether you're a small local shop or a growing online store, you get the same visibility as everyone else. No favorites, no algorithms favoring big brands - just fair play.

**The Result:**
More clicks, better engagement, and fair results for every business advertising on ClickaLinks.
