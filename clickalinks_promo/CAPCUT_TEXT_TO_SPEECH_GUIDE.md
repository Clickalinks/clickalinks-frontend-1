## 🎯 TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

### Tip 1: Write Script for Text-to-Speech

**Write Naturally:**
- Use conversational language
- Short sentences work best
- Avoid complex words (if possible)
- Add natural pauses with punctuation

**Example:**
```
Good: "ClickaLinks is affordable. Just £1 per day. No contracts. No hidden fees."

Bad: "ClickaLinks, which is an affordable advertising platform, costs just £1 per day, and there are no contracts or hidden fees."
```

### Tip 2: Add Punctuation for Natural Flow

**Use Punctuation:**
- **Comma (,):** Short pause
- **Period (.):** Medium pause
- **Ellipsis (...):** Longer pause
- **Exclamation (!):** Emphasis, energy
- **Question mark (?):** Natural question tone

**Example:**
```
"Advertising costs too much? We get it. That's why ClickaLinks starts at just £1 per day. No contracts. No hidden fees. Just affordable advertising that works."
```

### Tip 3: Break Script into Sections

**For Long Scripts:**
- Break into 2-3 text boxes
- Generate each separately
- Combine in timeline
- Easier to edit and adjust

**Example:**
```
Text Box 1: "Ever wonder if your ad gets buried while bigger brands dominate? That's the problem with most advertising platforms."

Text Box 2: "Not with ClickaLinks. Watch this. Every 2 hours, our system automatically shuffles ALL ads."

Text Box 3: "Fair advertising starts at £1 per day. Link in bio!"
```

### Tip 4: Test Different Voices

**Try Multiple Options:**
- Generate with 2-3 different voices
- Listen to each
- Pick the one that matches your video tone
- Save your favorite for future use

### Tip 5: Adjust Timing

**After Generation:**
- Listen to the voiceover
- Note the timing
- Adjust video clips to match
- Add pauses if needed (split audio)
